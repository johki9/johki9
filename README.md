I'm a Data Analyst at Tesla and prospective Master\'s candidate in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania. I also have a background in Mathematics from the University of Maryland. In my professional career I work with SQL, Python, and Tableau to create insights into Tesla's business operations.

In my personal time, I am learning about creating command line interfaces in Python and dimensional data modeling and system design.
